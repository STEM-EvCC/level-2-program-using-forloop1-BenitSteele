# Description - For loops
This code was made to look over rocket missions, the names, years, and success of those missions to check a few different items. I had it read first how many missions there were within the list given. After that I had it work on seeing how many were successful of the missions listed, from there it calculated the successful percentage of the missions. Getting the percentage was honestly a little rough for myself personally, I struggled a bit with coming up with the code to enable that. The next hardest part was coming up with the code to read both the names and years and tell the user which ones happened before the year 2000. I had to really try a lot of different code I've learned up to this point.
